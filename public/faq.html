                    <p>  A responsive design simply means a website that has been constructed so that all of the content, images and structure of the site remains the same on any device. Since most of the people are using smaller and portable devices, it is becoming more and more important that your website retains it’s experience on platforms such as mobile. If a user has to take extra effort to view your website on mobile, it is less likely that he would convert to a customer. </p>
